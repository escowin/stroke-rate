## Connection Conflict Management

### SpeedCoach Integration Challenge
Based on the [SpeedCoach GPS documentation](https://nksports.com/mwdownloads/download/link/id/144), heart rate monitors (Garmin HRM-Dual, WHOOP bands) typically connect to individual SpeedCoach devices during practice. This creates a **critical Bluetooth connection conflict** since most heart rate monitors can only maintain one active connection at a time.

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

#### **Primary Approach: App Priority with User Choice**
- **Detection**: App scans for heart rate devices and identifies existing SpeedCoach connections
- **User Interface**: Clear warning dialog when conflicts are detected
- **User Choice**: Allow coxswain to choose whether to disconnect from SpeedCoach
- **Graceful Handling**: Provide options to reconnect to SpeedCoach after session

#### **User Workflow for Connection Conflicts**
```
1. Coxswain opens app
2. App scans for heart rate devices
3. App detects existing SpeedCoach connections
4. App shows connection conflict warning:
   "3 heart rate monitors are connected to SpeedCoach devices.
   To use this app, you'll need to disconnect them from SpeedCoach.
   Continue? [Yes] [No]"
5. If Yes: App disconnects from SpeedCoach and connects to app
6. If No: App shows limited functionality or alternative options
7. After session: Option to restore SpeedCoach connections
```

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **Connection State Monitoring**: Track all active Bluetooth connections and their destinations
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify when heart rate monitors are connected to other devices
- **User Interface**: Clear conflict resolution dialogs with connection status display
- **Connection Management**: Safely disconnect from SpeedCoach and establish app connections
- **Reconnection Options**: Provide way to restore SpeedCoach connections post-session

### **Advantages of This Approach**
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Coxswain gets unified view of all 4 rowers' heart rate data
- **Enhanced Functionality**: App provides features SpeedCoach cannot (multi-device monitoring)
- **User Control**: Coxswain decides connection priority based on training needs
- **Flexibility**: Can switch between SpeedCoach and app usage as needed

## Risk Mitigation
