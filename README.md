- **Multi-Device Support**: Can connect to up to 4 heart rate devices simultaneously
- **SpeedCoach Conflict Detection**: Identifies when devices are already connected to SpeedCoach
- **Connection Management**: Maintains stable connections with automatic reconnection

### üéØ Heart Rate Monitoring

- **Real-Time Display**: Shows current BPM for each rower with color-coded zones
- **Heart Rate Zones**: Visual indicators for recovery, aerobic, threshold, and anaerobic zones
- **Historical Tracking**: Displays heart rate trends during sessions
- **Alert System**: Notifications for heart rate anomalies (Phase 2+)

### üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rower Management

- **Seat Assignment**: Map each heart rate device to specific rower positions (Bow, 2-seat, 3-seat, 4-seat)
- **Rower Profiles**: Store rower names, target heart rate zones, and historical data
- **Quick Setup**: Streamlined device-to-seat assignment workflow

### üîß SpeedCoach Integration

The app handles the critical challenge of Bluetooth connection conflicts with SpeedCoach devices:

- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically detects when heart rate monitors are connected to SpeedCoach
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Simple warning message when no devices found, coxswain communicates with rowers
- **Practical Solution**: Rowers disconnect from SpeedCoach, coxswain scans again and proceeds with setup

### üìä Data Visualization

- **Dashboard View**: Centralized display of all rowers' heart rate data
- **Individual Views**: Detailed view for each rower's biometric data
- **Real-Time Charts**: Live heart rate trend visualization
- **Zone Indicators**: Color-coded heart rate zone display
