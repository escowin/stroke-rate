# Stroke Rate - Heart Rate Monitor

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables coxswains to monitor real-time heart rate data from all rowers in a 4+ boat during training and racing.

## Phase 1 Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

This repository contains the **completed Phase 1** implementation of Stroke Rate, which establishes the core PWA infrastructure and basic Bluetooth connectivity. All Phase 1 deliverables and success criteria have been achieved.

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

- **PWA Setup**: React 18 + TypeScript with Vite, service worker, and manifest
- **Bluetooth Integration**: Web Bluetooth API with custom React hooks
- **SpeedCoach Conflict Detection**: System to identify and manage existing SpeedCoach connections
- **Streamlined Conflict Management**: Simple warning message and coxswain-to-rower communication workflow
- **Heart Rate Visualization**: Basic real-time heart rate display with Recharts
- **Core UI Components**: Responsive design with vanilla CSS
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automated deployment pipeline

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript 5.x
- **Build Tool**: Vite (optimized for PWA and performance)
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, perfect for this scope)
- **PWA**: Workbox for service worker management
- **Bluetooth**: Web Bluetooth API with custom React hooks
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (lightweight, mobile-first, accessible)
- **Charts**: Recharts (React-native, lightweight for heart rate trends)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- npm or yarn
- Modern browser with Web Bluetooth API support (Chrome/Edge on Android, Safari on iOS)

#### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stroke-rate.git
cd stroke-rate

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

#### Development

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### üì± PWA Features

- **Installable**: Can be installed on mobile devices as a native app
- **Offline Capable**: Core functionality works without internet connection
- **Responsive**: Optimized for mobile devices and tablets
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized bundle size and caching strategies

### üîó Bluetooth Integration

The app uses the Web Bluetooth API to connect to heart rate monitors:

- **Device Discovery**: Automatically scans for nearby heart rate devices
- **Multi-Device Support**: Can connect to up to 4 heart rate devices simultaneously
- **SpeedCoach Conflict Detection**: Identifies when devices are already connected to SpeedCoach
- **Connection Management**: Maintains stable connections with automatic reconnection

### üéØ Heart Rate Monitoring

- **Real-Time Display**: Shows current BPM for each rower with color-coded zones
- **Heart Rate Zones**: Visual indicators for recovery, aerobic, threshold, and anaerobic zones
- **Historical Tracking**: Displays heart rate trends during sessions
- **Alert System**: Notifications for heart rate anomalies (Phase 2+)

### üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rower Management

- **Seat Assignment**: Map each heart rate device to specific rower positions (Bow, 2-seat, 3-seat, 4-seat)
- **Rower Profiles**: Store rower names, target heart rate zones, and historical data
- **Quick Setup**: Streamlined device-to-seat assignment workflow

### üîß SpeedCoach Integration

The app handles the critical challenge of Bluetooth connection conflicts with SpeedCoach devices:

- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically detects when heart rate monitors are connected to SpeedCoach
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Simple warning message when no devices found, coxswain communicates with rowers
- **Practical Solution**: Rowers disconnect from SpeedCoach, coxswain scans again and proceeds with setup

### üìä Data Visualization

- **Dashboard View**: Centralized display of all rowers' heart rate data
- **Individual Views**: Detailed view for each rower's biometric data
- **Real-Time Charts**: Live heart rate trend visualization
- **Zone Indicators**: Color-coded heart rate zone display

### üöÄ Deployment

The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the main branch:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build and deployment pipeline
- **PWA Ready**: Full PWA manifest and service worker support
- **CDN Optimized**: Optimized for fast loading and caching

### üîÆ Next Phases

#### Phase 2: Multi-Device Support (Weeks 4-6)
- Enhanced multi-device connection management
- Improved device-to-seat assignment interface
- Simultaneous display of 4 rowers' heart rate data
- Advanced connection status monitoring

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization (Weeks 7-9)
- Heart rate zone calculation and display
- Historical data tracking during sessions
- Enhanced dashboard with trends and averages
- Alert system for heart rate anomalies

#### Phase 4: Training Integration (Weeks 10-12)
- Pre-defined workout templates
- Session analytics and reporting
- Progress tracking over time
- Data export functionality

#### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Weeks 13-14)
- Performance optimization and testing
- User experience improvements
- Documentation and user guide
- Beta testing with real rowing sessions
